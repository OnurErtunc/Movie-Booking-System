3- Demonstration of the list of movies
4- Demonstration of detailed information about a particular movie
5- Making a reservation on movies which are on the show
6- Cancellation of reservations (in progress)
7- Demonstration of a reservation

and it has some unique functionalities. These are
1- Restricted Seats: due to "assumed" covid-19 policies, each movie can have different seating plan. 
Which means that each movie has an audience radius provided by the distributor.
2- Unique reservation code: after each reservation, the system generates unique reservation code for 
clients.
