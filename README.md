# Movie-Booking-System

This is a very basic movie booking system program with 7 functionalities. These are
1- Addition of a movie to the system
2- Cancellation of a movie from the system
3- Demonstration of the list of movies in the system
4- Demonstration of detailed information about a particular movie
5- Making a reservation on movies which are on the show
6- Cancellation of reservations (in progress)
7- Demonstration of a reservation

and it has some unique functionalities. These are
1- Restricted Seats: due to "assumed" covid-19 policies, each movie can have different seating plan. 
Which means that each movie has an audience radius provided by the distributor.
2- Unique reservation code: after each reservation, the system generates unique reservation code for 
clients.

Movie Booking System is currently using a console based UI. No graphical user interface is supported.

In this version, Movie Booking System is using dynamic arrays for storage. The linked list implementation is in progress
